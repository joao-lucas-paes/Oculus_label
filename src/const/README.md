# Goal

- This section is done only for constants, so each file will be an domain.

## How to make

- Inside each domain must be ordered by blocks, each block start by an `//#region ${NAME}$` comment and be ended by an `//#endregion`.
- All constants must be named in UPPER_SNAKE_CASE.
- All operations should be made by constants named (e.g `const HOUR_IN_SECONDS = MINUTES_IN_SECONDS * HOUR_IN_MINUTES`)
- All constants must be commented with an multiple line comment (`/* ... */`)
