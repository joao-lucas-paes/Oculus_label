# Goal

This is an test‑suite for all components across every domain. Its principles are:

1. **Ensure quality before changes**  
   - All tests should be aproved before all deployment or critical modification.

2. **Redundancy over gaps**  
   - Having overlapping tests is preferable to under-testing.
   - Passing all tests does **not** mean that the code is free of bugs or problems.

3. **Simple and maintainable**  
   - Tests should be easy to understand, execute, and extend.
   - Each test should focus on a single behavior.

> **Note**: This suite includes unit, integration, and end‑to‑end tests.
